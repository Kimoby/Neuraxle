# What it is

My pull request does: 


# How it works

I coded it this way: 


# Example usage

Here is how you can use this new code as a end user: 

```python 
# Note: Please make dimensions and types clear to the reader. 
# E.g.: in the event fictious data is processed in this code example.
# Replace the current code example with your own. 
# You may then use this PR code example to further document your code as a docstring!
pass
```


<!-- Checklist before merging PR

Things to check each time you contribute:

[ ] Argument's dimensions and types are specified for new steps (important), with examples in docstrings when needed.
[ ] Class names and argument / API variables are very clear: there is no possible ambiguity. They also respect the existing code style (avoid duplicating words for the same concept).
[ ] Classes are documented: their behavior is explained beyond just the title of the class.
[ ] If a numpy array is used, it is important to remember that these arrays are a special type that must be documented accordingly, and that numpy array should not be abused. This is because Neuraxle is a library that is not only limited to transforming numpy arrays. To this effect, numpy steps should probably be located in the existing numpy python files as much as possible, and not be all over the place. The same applies to Pandas DataFrames.
[ ] Code coverage is above 90% for the added code for the unit tests.
[ ] The above description of the pull request in natural language was used to document the new code inside the code's docstrings so as to have complete documentation, with examples.
[ ] Respect the Unit Testing status check
[ ] Respect the Codacy status check
[ ] Respect the cla-bot status check (unless the cla-bot is truly broken - please try to debug it first)
[ ] Code files that were edited were reformatted automatically using PyCharm's `Ctrl+Alt+L` shortcut.
